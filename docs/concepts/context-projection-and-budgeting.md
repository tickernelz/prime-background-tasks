# Context projection and budgeting

Primary sources: `src/core/context/parent-snapshot.ts`, `src/core/context/visible-conversation-v2.ts`, and `src/core/context/token-budget.ts`.

## Shared visible conversation transform

`VISIBLE_CONVERSATION_TRANSFORM_ID` is `visible-conversation-ledger-v2`. It is shared by Fusion reason and delegate seeding so each consumer gets the same disposition for the same parent session bytes.

The transform has no behavioral knobs:

- user text: retained verbatim;
- assistant text: retained verbatim;
- assistant thinking: omitted into the ledger;
- tool-call arguments: omitted into the ledger;
- tool-result text: omitted into the ledger;
- tool-result images: ledger-only;
- user images: marker-only text (`[Image omitted from fusion text transcript: <mime>]`);
- empty text blocks: counted, not serialized;
- unknown roles/block types: loud `UnsupportedConversationBlockError`.

Each omitted event records source ordinal, block ordinal, kind, payload byte length, payload SHA-256, and optional tool/mime metadata. The ledger root is hash-framed and independent of consumer envelopes, so Fusion and delegate can seal the same transform output into different schemas without changing the underlying omitted-event commitment.

## Parent snapshot and branch exclusion

`parent-snapshot.ts` adapts Pi `SessionManager` entries into LLM messages. Tool callers can exclude the active assistant leaf that contains the in-flight tool call; this prevents the child from seeing its own request and sibling calls as completed parent history. Commands do not exclude a leaf.

Callers must snapshot once and complete downstream launch/admission from that frozen snapshot. Re-reading the parent session during launch would allow seed drift.

## Reason input vs clean input

- Fusion `reason` uses the parent visible-conversation projection. Its canonical input includes the system prompt, request authority, projection entries, accounting, and a separate `context-omission-ledger.json` artifact.
- Fusion `investigate`, `research`, and `validate` use clean-task input. They carry the explicit request and declared sources where applicable; they intentionally do not carry parent system prompt, conversation projection, or omission ledger.
- Delegate uses the shared projection inside its seed, but its directive text is marked authoritative and projected history is supporting/untrusted.

No path silently truncates parent context. Oversized projections or prompts must be rejected with budget details or represented by hashed artifact receipts where that consumer defines a receipt protocol.

## Token estimator concepts

`token-budget.ts` is byte arithmetic, not a tokenizer. It produces upper-bound style estimates from UTF-8 byte classes:

- `normal` known text/json bytes;
- `multibyte` bytes;
- `dense_ascii` bytes;
- `unknown_output_contract` bytes.

Families are `anthropic`, `openai-codex`, and `unknown`. Exact model overrides currently include Anthropic Opus/Fable routes and OpenAI Codex GPT routes. Unknown providers and unbacked models fall to a provable 1.00 B/token floor.

Calibration facts in code:

- calibration id: `prime-background-tasks.input-token-calibration.v1`;
- large-prompt floor: 50 KiB;
- affine fixed reserve: 512 tokens;
- observed large Fusion prompt corpus: 882 prompts, dated 2026-08-02;
- Anthropic configured rate: 1.73 B/token after haircut;
- OpenAI Codex configured rate: 2.89 B/token after haircut;
- delegate launch uses backed family calibration only for large prompts on routes that can hold the calibration domain; small prompts/routes, unbacked models, unknown providers, and dense-ASCII out-of-domain cases use conservative/floor rates;
- delegate runtime context estimates are advisory, while a separate provable `1.00 B/token` retained-growth budget drives explicit spilling and no-tool finalization.

The dense-ASCII gate is explicitly a low-whitespace heuristic proxy, not a tokenizer guarantee. Calibration applies only when the input is in the measured domain and the route capacity can hold that domain.

## Budget invariants

- `allowedInputTokens()` returns a signed number and never clamps unusable routes to zero.
- Callers must reject unusable or too-small context windows before spawning children.
- Multibyte bytes cannot bypass accounting; delegate's published provable counter-forecast charges them at the same `1.00 B/token` ceiling as every other byte class.
- Unknown output contracts are charged separately; future output cannot be assumed to be cheap.
- Rate-source warnings are part of the contract and should be surfaced in refusal details.
- A package-local estimate must not reject a live provider payload by subtracting hypothetical output; Fusion BUG-185 established this as a false-refusal shape. Use conservative estimates for lossless spill decisions, where a false positive preserves bytes rather than failing work.

## No silent truncation

Model-visible context may be compacted only by explicit policy receipts with exact accounting and hashes. It must never be clipped, head/tail previewed, route-substituted, or hidden behind a fallback estimator without reporting the source and limitation.
