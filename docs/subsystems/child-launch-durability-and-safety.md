# Child launch, durability, and safety

Primary sources: `src/core/durable-fs.ts` and `src/core/task-files.ts`.

## Pi launch resolution

On non-Windows platforms, `resolvePiLaunch()` returns `{ executable: 'pi', argvPrefix: [], kind: 'path' }`.

On Windows, the package does not trust shell PATH shims. It resolves `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent/package.json`, reads `bin.pi`, realpaths the package root and bin target, verifies the target stays inside the package root, and accepts only a regular file with one of these forms:

- `.js`, `.cjs`, `.mjs`: launch with `process.execPath` and the target as `argvPrefix[0]`;
- `.exe`, `.com`: launch the target directly.

Resolution failures throw `PiLaunchResolutionError` with code `pi_executable_resolution_failed`; no substitute route or shell fallback is selected.

## Windows argv and command-line length

`assertWindowsCommandLineWithinLimit()` renders the exact Windows command line with Windows quoting rules, measures UTF-16 length plus the terminating NUL, and throws `PiCommandLineLimitError` (`pi_command_line_too_long`) if it exceeds 32,767 characters. The check is used before child launches that construct `pi` argv.

Delegate seed bytes are delivered over stdin, not argv, so large seeds do not rely on command-line quoting or shell length limits.

## Durable write invariant

`durable-fs.ts` provides two public operations:

- `writeFileDurable(path, data)`: open the target once with `w`, write, `sync()`, close.
- `replaceFileDurable(path, data)`: create a task-owned temp file with exclusive `wx` at `0o600`, write, `sync()`, close, rename over the target, then directory-sync on non-Windows.

Invariant: a pathname is never reopened merely to fsync it. Sync failures are fatal and surfaced as `DurableFileError`; cleanup failures are retained in the error object instead of hiding the primary failure.

Temp ownership matters: if exclusive temp creation collides, the caller does not delete the other writer's file. A successful rename is the commit point; if a post-rename directory sync fails, the error marks `renameCompleted: true` because the replacement may already be visible.

## POSIX directory sync limitation

After atomic replace, POSIX-like platforms open and sync the parent directory to durably record the rename. Windows skips directory sync because Node/Windows directory fsync is not portable in the same way. This is an explicit platform limitation, not a silent success claim; file contents are still written and synced before rename.

## Process trust boundaries

- Background shell tasks run the operator-provided shell command in the project cwd and are not sandboxed.
- Delegate children are direct `pi` spawns, not shell commands. They use a task-owned session id and session dir, stripped parent session environment, disabled discovery, and an explicit child guard extension; Anthropic delegates first load the package attribution extension.
- Fusion children are direct `pi --mode text` spawns with private metadata/tool-call audit extensions and workflow-specific tool policy; Anthropic children first load the package attribution extension.
- Attested Pi tasks are direct `pi --mode json` spawns and produce evidence sidecars after successful parsing and durability; Anthropic tasks receive the package attribution extension explicitly.

Never blur parent and child authority: parent tools can start/inspect/kill tasks, but child tools must stay within their explicit argv tool set.

## Terminal integrity

Task terminal status is not published until output streams are ended and observed finished/closed and terminal metadata is written. Ordinary task `.output` streams are not explicitly fsynced; attested event/stderr buffers and atomic metadata/artifact paths use the durable helpers described above. If stream close or terminal metadata fails, the task is marked failed; terminal truth is not guessed from the process exit alone.
