- Description: Inspect one background task or list all running/recent background tasks. This is a point-in-time inspection tool, not a waiting primitive.
- Root schema: `object`

| Field | Required | Type | Description | Constraints |

| `taskId` | no | `string` | Optional task ID or unambiguous prefix. If omitted, all running/recent tasks are returned. |  |

Inspect one background task or list all running/recent tasks.

## Schema


Optional fields:

- `taskId: string` — exact task id or unambiguous prefix. If omitted, all retained tasks are returned.

## When to use

Use for deliberate point-in-time inspection: the user asks for an update, completion handling was disabled, or there is concrete evidence a task is hung.

Do **not** use `bg_status` as a polling or waiting primitive. A `running` result is not an instruction to call it again, and a terminal notification does not need reconfirmation.

## Defaults

No `taskId` means list all tasks retained by this extension runtime.

## Lifecycle

Returns current snapshots. Status values are exactly `running`, `completed`, `failed`, and `killed`.

## Examples

```json
{}
```

```json
{"taskId":"b1234"}
```

## Output/result

Text content uses the same snapshot formatting as [`/jobs`](../commands/jobs.md), including output path. Structured details are:

```ts
{ tasks: BgTaskSnapshot[] }
```

Each snapshot includes delivery flags, notification state, optional telemetry reported by the task, and optional error.

## Errors

- Missing id is only possible when an empty string is supplied: `Task ID is required`.
- Unknown id/prefix: `Unknown background task ID: <id>`.
- Ambiguous prefix: lists matching task ids.

Tool execution rejects loudly; there is no silent fallback to an empty list.

## Runtime artifacts

Read-only in-memory snapshots. It does not read or write `.pi/tasks` files.

## Safety boundaries

Inspection only. Not a polling primitive, not a wait loop, and not a task-control operation.

## Source ownership/reference

Tool registration lives in `src/extension.ts`; snapshots and task resolution are owned by [background-task-runtime](../subsystems/background-task-runtime.md).
