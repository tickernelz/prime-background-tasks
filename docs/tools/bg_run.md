# `bg_run`

<!-- pi-docs:begin name="tool-contract-bg_run" generator="scripts/docs/generate.mjs" -->
- Label: **Background Run**
- Source: `src/extension.ts:614`
- Description: Start a named long-running shell command in the background and return immediately with a task ID and output path. By default, completed, failed, or killed terminal state is delivered automatically as <background-task-notification> and starts a follow-up agent turn; do not sleep or poll merely to wait. Output is written to .pi/tasks and model-visible logs are bounded to 50.0KB.
- Root schema: `object`

| Field | Required | Type | Description | Constraints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `command` | yes | `string` | Shell command to start in the background |  |
| `description` | no | `string` | Optional longer human-readable context for the task |  |
| `isAgent` | yes | `boolean` | Required. Set true only when this background task launches an LLM/agent process, such as a child `pi -p ...` or `pi --mode json ...`, so Pi-agent telemetry can be collected. Set false for scripts, tests, servers, sleeps, and ordinary shell commands. |  |
| `name` | yes | `string` | Short human-readable task name shown in the bg footer dock. Required; use 2-6 words, not the raw command. |  |
| `notifyOnCompletion` | no | `boolean` | Whether to deliver the durable terminal notification. Default: true; disable only when deliberately taking over completion monitoring. |  |
| `timeoutSeconds` | no | `number` | Optional timeout; task is failed and killed when exceeded |  |
| `triggerOnCompletion` | no | `boolean` | Whether that notification should automatically trigger a follow-up agent turn. Default: true for bg_run; requires notifyOnCompletion. |  |

Start a named long-running shell command in the background and return immediately.

## Schema


Required public fields:

- `name: string` — concise 2-6 word task name for the footer dock.
- `command: string` — shell command to run.
- `isAgent: boolean` — explicit telemetry control; `true` only for LLM/agent processes such as child `pi -p ...` or `pi --mode json ...`.

Optional fields:

- `description: string`
- `timeoutSeconds: number`
- `notifyOnCompletion: boolean`
- `triggerOnCompletion: boolean`

Legacy argument preparation can derive a missing `name` from `description` or `command`, but the public schema remains strict and requires `name`, `command`, and `isAgent`.

## When to use

Use for long-running tests, builds, servers, watchers, sleeps, and child agent work. Do not use normal foreground shell tools for commands expected to outlive the current turn.

For an Anthropic child `pi`, keep normal extension discovery enabled. Do not pass `--no-extensions` unless the command also explicitly loads this package's `extensions/anthropic-attribution.ts` with `-e`/`--extension`.

## Defaults

- `notifyOnCompletion`: `true`.
- `triggerOnCompletion`: `true`.
- `timeoutSeconds`: absent means no timeout.
- `isAgent`: no default in the tool contract; callers must provide a boolean. It is not inferred from command text.

## Lifecycle

The tool returns a task id, current `running` status, pid if known, output path, and completion-delivery guidance. Terminal statuses are exactly `completed`, `failed`, or `killed`. With default delivery, terminal state is sent as `<background-task-notification>` and starts a follow-up agent turn; after launching, do not sleep or poll merely to wait.

## Examples

```json
{"name":"Docs build","command":"npm run docs","isAgent":false}
```

```json
{"name":"Child summary","command":"pi -p 'summarize changes'","isAgent":true,"timeoutSeconds":600}
```

```json
{"name":"Manual server","command":"npm run dev","isAgent":false,"notifyOnCompletion":false,"triggerOnCompletion":false}
```

## Output/result

Text result:

```text
Started background task <name> (<id>)
Status: running
PID: <pid|unknown>
Output: .pi/tasks/.../<id>.output
Terminal notification: enabled.
Automatic follow-up turn: enabled.
...
```

Structured details include `task`, a snapshot with command, status, output path, cwd, timing, pid, byte count, `isAgent`, delivery flags, telemetry fields when available, and error when present.

## Errors

- Missing/non-object args in preparation: `bg_run arguments must be an object`.
- Missing command: `bg_run requires command string`.
- Missing `isAgent`: loud error explaining true/false use.
- Empty command at execution: `Background command is empty`.
- Shell/spawn/timeout/output-cap failures become loud task failures.

## Runtime artifacts

Creates `.pi/tasks/<session-id>-<pid>/<task-id>.output` and `.json`. If `isAgent:true` and the command matches an interceptable POSIX `pi -p`, `pi --print`, or `pi --mode json` invocation, a temporary telemetry wrapper file is also written in the task directory.

## Safety boundaries

The command runs through the platform shell and is not sandboxed. Use `isAgent:true` only to request Pi-agent telemetry wrapping; setting it does not make execution safer. Model-visible logs are bounded and point to the full output path.

`bg_run` does not parse or repair arbitrary child `pi` argv. An Anthropic command that uses `--no-extensions` without explicitly loading the attribution extension bypasses the package's attribution/sanitization contract and is unsupported.
